            station WTHR engaged in an extensive investigation beginning in 2006

            Miami, New Haven (Conn.), Philadelphia, Phoenix, and CVS headquarters

            documents, such as labels from prescription bottles and old prescriptions,

For example, he used one victim's identification to obtain a credit card through U.S. Bank. With that card, he wound up withdrawing $30,529.63 in cash from ATMs throughout Minnesota.

It discovered the intrusion mid-December 2006. Transaction data from 2003 as well as mid-May through December 2006 may have been accessed. According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected. Totals were estimated at 94 million but now seem to have affected over 100 million accounts.UPDATE  (2/22/2007):TJX said that while it first thought the intrusion took place from May 2006 to January 2007, it now thinks its computer system was also hacked in July 2005 and on various subsequent dates that year.UPDATE (3/21/2007): Information stolen from TJX's systems was being used fraudulently in November 2006 in an $8 million gift card scheme, one month before TJX officials said they learned of the breach, according to Florida law enforcement officials. UPDATE  (3/29/2007): The company reported in its SEC filing that 45.7 million credit and debit card numbers were hacked, along with 455,000 merchandise return records containing customers' driver's license numbers, Military ID numbers or Social Security numbers. UPDATE (4/22/2007): Initially, TJX said the break-in started seven months before it was discovered. Then, on Feb. 18, the company noted the perpetrators had access to data for 17 months, and apparently began in July 2005. UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards. UPDATE (05/04/2007): An article in the WSJ notes that because TJX had an outdated wireless security encryption system, had failed to install firewalls and data encryption on computers using the wireless network, and had not properly install another layer of security software it had bought, thieves were able to access data streaming between hand-held price-checking devices, cash registers and the store's computers. 21 U.S. and Canadian lawsuits seek damages from the retailer for reissuing compromised cards. UPDATE (07/10/2007): U.S. Secret Service agents found TJX customers' credit card numbers in the hands of Eastern European cyber thieves who created high-quality counterfeit credit cards. Victims are from the U.S., Europe, Asia and Canada, among other places, Several Cuban nationals in Florida were arrested with more than 200,000 credit card account numbers.

Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service.

Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.","Dataloss DB","2007",-71.4161565,42.279286
